### Features  
> This application features a simple daily calendar wherein the user can schedule a workday using individual blocks defined by the hour.  The user must simply click inside the colored textbox area to modify their to-do list at the scheduled time.  The blue blocks to the right of each text area, indicating by a floppy disk symbol, allow the user to click and save their daily list to local storage, so that upon revisiting the application, the saved text within each hour is rendered continuous across time, until modified again by the user.  

> A time block with a grey background indicates that the hour has passed, a time block with an orange background indicates the current hour, and one with a green background indicates an hour of time that has not yet arrived.
